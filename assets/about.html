<h2>What is EuroMirror?</h2>
<div>
<p>If there are no borders for commerce or workforce in the European Union, why should there be for information? <b>EuroMirror</b> is an app for reading news about EU countries from the perspective of other member states' journalists.</p>
<p><i>Please note that, since updates are manually curated, there may be a delay of a couple of days from when news take place to its appearance in here.</i></p>
</div>
<h2>Who is behind this (and why)</h2>
<div>
<p>EuroMirror is an idea by <a href="http://juanruitina.com/en">Juan Ruitiña</a>, a Journalism student from Spain. It got the second place in Generation 1992, a contest by the European Commission for we people who were born the same year <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty">Maastricht Treaty</a> was signed.</p>
</div>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div>
<p><b>Why is EuroMirror only available in English?</b> — The European Union has up to 23 official languages, but English is the most widely spoken (according to Wikipedia, 51% of the total population understand it). This app is intended to get the wider audience possible, and that's why all the news will be offered in English even for your own country —good news for Irish and British citizens, right? ;)</p>
<p><b>But I want to practice languages!</b> — Okaaay, that's great, I get it. Sites like Busuu and Sharedtalk may help you. Do you want to read some EU news in other languages? Search PressEurop in Google Play.</p>
<p><b>Why isn't my country listed?</b> — EuroMirror offers news for the five most populated countries in the EU, but you can help adding more by contacting me: just send a mail to <i>eum@juanruitina.com</i>.</p>
<!--<p><b>Why does this app looks so ugly?</b> — Compatibility with Android 1.5 is one of the requirements of Generation 1992 contest, so I had to guarantee the HTML/CSS/JS I used worked properly in such an old version. I plan to update the design when the contest finishes, though.</p>-->
